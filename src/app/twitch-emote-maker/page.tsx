      intro="Twitch requires every emote to be uploaded in three exact sizes: 28×28, 56×56 and 112×112 pixels, as transparent PNG files under 1 MB each. Resizing these by hand in Photoshop is tedious and easy to get wrong. EmoteForge does it in one step — entirely inside your browser, so your artwork is never uploaded to a server. Drop your image, preview how it looks at real chat size, fine-tune padding and background, and download a Twitch-ready ZIP."

          q: "Why is my Twitch emote blurry?",
          a: "Blurriness usually happens when a small image is scaled up. Start from the highest-resolution artwork you have; EmoteForge downscales with high-quality smoothing to keep edges crisp at every size.",
