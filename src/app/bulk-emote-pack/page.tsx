          Creating a full set of Twitch or Kick emotes one image at a time is slow. The bulk
          pack maker takes any number of images, resizes each to all required sizes, optimizes
          them to meet platform file-size limits, and packages everything into a tidy ZIP with
          one folder per emote. Nothing is uploaded — all processing happens locally on your
          device, so even large sets stay completely private.
